# Basic-FFNN

My attempt of implementing one from scratch using numpy, so I can develop a better intuition for the material I'm learning.

## On hold

Putting this project on hold (near completion), to make a FFNN visualising tool, to help me debug/understand some of the weird behaviour in the test neural networks.
